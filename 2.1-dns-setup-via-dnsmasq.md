# Consul DNS Setup via dnsmasq

I prefer this method because it doesn't interfere with other DNS config you may have to do depending on the complexity of your environment (e.g. systemd-resolved).

For up-to-date instructions just follow [the official docs](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/dns-forwarding#dnsmasq-setup).


## Basically:

    sudo apt-get install dnsmasq
    sudo systemctl restart dnsmasq

Add this configuration to a new dnsmasq config file:

    vim /etc/dnsmasq.d/10-consul

Content:

    # Enable forward lookup of the 'consul' domain:
    server=/consul/127.0.0.1#8600
